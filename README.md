# Terraform
This repository has been created for managing terraform codes.
# How Terraform Works
Terraform allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned.

Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and hardware services.
# Write, Plan, Apply
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

# Features
Write declarative config files
Define infrastructure as code to manage the full lifecycle â€” create new resources, manage existing ones, and destroy those no longer needed.
